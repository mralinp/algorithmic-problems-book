    "First, let's define the sub-sequence. A sub-sequence is sequence which length is smaller or equal to to original sequence and all elements of the sub-sequence should exist on the original sequence. The order of elements in sub-sequence is important and the order of element is the same as the original set. Lets assume the word 'ali' as our origin sequence, word 'a', 'al', 'li' are all sub-sequences for the word 'ali' but, 'la' is not a sub-sequence for the word ali because of the wrong order for the words. The word 'ai' is also a sub-sequence for the word 'ali' because all word of this sequence are a part of the original sequence and their order is a correct.\n",
