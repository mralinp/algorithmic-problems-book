    "First, let's define the sub-sequence. A sub-sequence is sequence which length is smaller or equal to to original sequence and all elements of the sub-sequence should exist on the original sequence. The order of elements in sub-sequence is important and the order of element is the same as the original set. Lets assume the word 'ali' as our origin sequence, word 'a', 'al', 'li' are all sub-sequences for the word 'ali' but, 'la' is not a sub-sequence for the word ali because of the wrong order for the words. The word 'ai' is also a sub-sequence for the word 'ali' because all word of this sequence are a part of the original sequence and their order is a correct.\n",

    "1. $  \\forall x \\in B \\Rightarrow x \\in A $\n",
    "2. $ |B| \\le |A| $\n",
    "3. $ \\forall x, y \\in B \\wedge x \\neq y  \\wedge index_B(x) < index_B(y) \\Rightarrow index_A(x) < index_A(y) $\n",

    "For all of these three parts we can ether use recursive or non-recursive methods for our implementations. However using recursive method is recommended because it's easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember from high school? or may be you don't because you're already in high school! don't worry i'll explain it to you.\n",
    "To count the sub sequences of a sequence we can assume that for each element of the sequence, it has two options, it is in the sub-sequence or it is not. but if we choose it to be in the sub-sequence, nether of its preducer could be in sequence after this element. In a recursive approach, each time, we chose an element and call the function to solve to problem for the rest of the sequence.\n"
