    "Nowadays, the most low-end CPU running on a regular computer has at least 1GHz of clock speed. We assume that each arithmetic operation will be accomplished on each clock, so we can say that$10^9$ ($1,000,000,000$), arithmetic operations will be executed within a second by the computer's CPU. Usually, in competitive programming, the worst case of code runtime is about 1 to 5 seconds. If they explicitly didn't mention a time limit for the problem, you have to assume a one-second time limit for that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "They didn't say anything about the time limit for this problem, so that we assume a one-second time limit for this problem. If so, 1000 ($=10^3$) arithmetic operations would be noting compared to $10^9$ operations, and its execution time will be suitable for the implementation."
