    "## The ruler function\n",
    "The ruler function $f$, is defined on natural numbers; $f(k)$ equals one plus the biggest power of two which counts $k$. It could be proved all permutations of numbers from $1$ to $n$ is a subsequences of the sequence:\n",
    "$$ f(1),f(2),...,f(2^n-1) $$\n",
    "For example, if the permutations is $(2,4,3,1)$ the sequence will be $f(1),...,f(15)$. Red numbers specify the subsequences:\n",
    "    $$ 1,\\textcolor{red}{2},1,3,1,2,1,\\textcolor{red}{4},1,2,1,\\textcolor{red}{3},1,2,\\textcolor{red}{1} $$\n",
    "The task is, write a program which takes the number $n$ and a permutation of numbers from $1$ to $n$ and calculates the subsequence. For each input, in the first line you are given the number $n$ $(n \\le 10)$, and in the second line a permutation of numbers from $1$ to $n$. In the output you have to print the sequence $f(1),...,f(n)$ and at the first line and the indexes of the subsequences arguments in the second line separated by a sequence. **(Assume that, the indexes starting from $1$)**\n",
