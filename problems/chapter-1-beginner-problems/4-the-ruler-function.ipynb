    "## Solution\n",
    "In this question, we know that always $n \\le 30,000$. And the factorial of 8 equals (40,320). So, $ 8! > max(n)$ and we can conclude we only have to use the factorials of numbers in the range $[1:7]$ for our calculations. This problem has a funny bug; for each number $n$, we can print $n\\times1!$, and this is always correct. But let's assume that the author wanted to say a different thing; the sum of the factorial multiplicands shod be minimum. If so, we can take a greedy approach to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach for this problem is known as the \"Greedy Coin Change\" approach. We start from the most significant factorial and iteratively divide the number with the next greatest factorial until the remainder becomes zero."
